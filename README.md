== Consensus Clustering in R ==

This is the consensus clustering approach of Monti, Tamayo,
Mesirov and Golub. This implementation is intended to allow
the user to use their own favourite clustering functions as
the 'base learner' and to have an interface that most R
users would find intuitive.

AstraZeneca is partially funding this work.
